# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code working in this repository.

## What this is

**Sovereign** — a modular, self-hostable workspace runtime. A shared platform
(auth, DB, email, UI) hosts installable **plugins** as first-class apps. The
plugin system _is_ the product, not an app extended with plugins. Open source,
privacy-first, single-tenant/multi-user in v1.

## Source of truth

Two documents define everything. Read the relevant sections before any task —
they are authoritative over assumptions:

- `docs/sovereign-proposal-plan-srs.md` — Concept, Plan, Architecture, SRS,
  manifest reference, decision log.
- `docs/roadmap.md` — Chronological task index (version → epic task ID → status).
  Full task detail lives in `docs/epics/`. Each task = one branch = one PR.

**Task workflow** — how to start, implement, and complete a task (including the
`CURRENT_TASK.md` mechanism and epic task IDs): `docs/development-workflow.md`.

## Working conventions

- **One task at a time.** Implement a single task, verify its review checklist,
  then stop for human review. Do not start a task on an unmerged PR.
- **Tasks are sequenced** — each depends on the previous unless tagged
  `[parallel]`. Don't skip ahead.
- **Branch per task**, always cut from an **up-to-date `main`** — run
  `git switch main && git pull` first. Name by change type:
  - `feat/<slug>` — features
  - `fix/<slug>` — bug fixes
  - `docs/<slug>` — documentation
  - `chore/<slug>` — tooling, scaffolding, deps, maintenance

  e.g. `feat/shared-tsconfig`, `chore/scaffold-monorepo`.
  _(Post-v1.0.0 this changes: `main` becomes the production branch and `dev`
  the integration branch — branch from `dev` then. Until then, base off `main`.)_

- **Doc task numbers (e.g. `0.3.02`) are for local tracking only.** Never put
  them in branch names, commit messages, or PR titles/descriptions. Refer to the
  work by what it does, not its task number.
- **Epic task IDs (`<epic>.<seq>`, e.g. `9.9`) are permanent stable identifiers.**
  Use them in doc cross-references, RFC `incorporated_into_plan` fields, and task
  dependency lists. **Roadmap slot versions (e.g. `0.9.2`) are volatile** — they
  reflect current priority ordering and may shift when tasks are reprioritized.
  Always look up the live slot from `docs/roadmap.md` rather than hard-coding it in
  docs; include slots only where shipping order matters (upgrade notes, version maps).
- **Commits** end with a `Co-Authored-By` trailer specific to the tool used:
  - If **Claude Code** is the coding agent; end with the trailer (model-agnostic — do not use a specific model name,
    as multiple models may contribute to one task): `Co-Authored-By: Claude Code <noreply@anthropic.com>`
- **PRs** target `main`; body ends with the Claude Code attribution line.
  Describe what changed and why, and cite relevant SRS sections — but no task numbers.
  🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) (if **Claude Code** is the coding agent)
- **Merge strategy: rebase and merge** (never squash, never create a merge
  commit). Keeps history linear — each task's commit lands on `main` verbatim.
- **Fix commit messages BEFORE merging the PR.** Once a squash-merge lands on
  `main`, correcting it means rewriting/force-pushing `main` — avoid that.
- **When a task is done, always update both `docs/roadmap.md` and `CLAUDE.md`
  in the same PR.** Mark the task ✅ in the roadmap, add a ✅ completion entry
  to the CLAUDE.md Status section, and add a `⏳ Next: Task X.X.XX — <title>`
  line at the end of the Status section so the next session knows immediately
  what to start without re-reading the roadmap. Never leave the Status section
  without a "⏳ Next" marker — if a PR completes the last task in a phase,
  point at the first task of the next phase.
- **Verify before claiming done.** Run the task's review-checklist commands and
  show the output.
- Never merge a PR automatically. Either wait for explicit instruction to merge,
  or ask for consent before doing so.
- **Flag Docker-config impact immediately.** While building features or fixing
  bugs, whenever a change requires updating the Docker setup (`Dockerfile`,
  `apps/auth/Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.prod.yml`,
  `.dockerignore`) — e.g. a new/renamed env var, a new port, a new on-disk path
  (writable dir or served asset dir), a new native dep, or anything affecting
  `next build`/standalone output — call it out in the same turn and update the
  relevant config (or ask), rather than letting it drift behind the code.
- **Docs are part of the change.** Changing the manifest schema
  (`packages/manifest`), the SDK surface (`packages/sdk`), or env vars
  (`.env.example`) means updating the matching doc in the same PR —
  `docs/plugin-development.md` (manifest fields, permissions, SDK methods) and
  `docs/self-hosting.md` (env vars). The `runtime/src/docs-parity.test.ts` parity
  test enforces the enumerable parts (every field/permission/SDK key/env var must
  appear in its doc) and fails CI otherwise; review covers the prose.
  **The parity test is one-directional** (`.env.example` → `self-hosting.md`); it
  does not catch env vars consumed by the code but absent from `.env.example`.
  That direction is a human convention: every env var read from `process.env` in
  either app must be declared (or commented-out) in `.env.example`, even if it
  has a safe default, so operators know it exists.
- **Version bumps** are part of the PR — bump the relevant `package.json`(s)
  in the same branch, following semver tied to the change type:
  - `fix/` → **patch** (0.0.x)
  - `feat/` → **minor** (0.x.0)
  - Breaking change → **major** (x.0.0) — also requires a migration note in
    `docs/upgrade.md`
  - `chore/` / `docs/` → no version bump unless a public API changed

  The **SDK** (`packages/sdk`) and **UI** (`packages/ui`) are under an
  additional constraint per NFR-04: patch releases must never contain breaking
  changes; breaking changes require at minimum a minor bump and a migration
  note, regardless of branch type. Both packages are published to npm as
  `@sovereignfs/sdk` and `@sovereignfs/ui` — they are public contracts for
  plugin developers.

  The **platform version** in the root `package.json` tracks roadmap phase
  milestones — **minor bumps for completed phases, patch bumps for completed
  pre-release hardening tasks (1.0.xx), and a single jump to `1.0.0` at the
  public release.** The current version is **`0.9.3`** (phases 0.3–0.9 complete
  - three 1.0.xx hardening tasks). Do **not** bump the minor for individual tasks
    within a phase — minor bumps happen once per completed roadmap phase. The
    downgrade guard, plugin compatibility gates (RFC 0024), and `/api/admin/health`
    all read this value; see `docs/versioning.md` for the full version map and
    rectification plan.

  **Per-package versions are independent of the platform version.** Internal,
  private packages (`@sovereignfs/db`, `runtime`, `auth`, `manifest`, `mailer`,
  plugins) follow normal semver tied to the change type above and **may cross
  `1.0.0`** on a breaking change — their versions are internal, not the
  user-facing product version (e.g. `@sovereignfs/db` is `1.0.0`). The published
  packages **`@sovereignfs/sdk`** (already `1.x`, the stable contract) and
  **`@sovereignfs/ui`** follow their own public semver per NFR-04 and are
  **exempt** from the platform's "stay under v1" rule.

## Code quality

Established in Task 0.3.3. Every package and PR must comply — no exceptions.

### Tools

| Tool                       | Purpose                                                       |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prettier**               | Formatting — single source of truth for style                 |
| **ESLint 9 (flat config)** | Linting — correctness, best practices, SDK boundary rule      |
| `typescript-eslint`        | TypeScript-specific ESLint rules (recommended + strict)       |
| `eslint-config-prettier`   | Disables ESLint formatting rules that conflict with Prettier  |
| `simple-git-hooks`         | Pre-commit hook runner (lighter than Husky, no shell scripts) |
| `lint-staged`              | Runs Prettier then ESLint only on staged files (fast)         |
| `.editorconfig`            | Editor-level baseline — indent, line endings, charset         |

### Formatting conventions (Prettier)

- Single quotes
- Semicolons
- Trailing commas (`all`)
- Print width: 100
- Tab width: 2 spaces

### Rules

- **Never disable ESLint rules inline** (`// eslint-disable`) without a comment
  explaining why, and never disable the SDK boundary rule.
- **Prefix intentionally-unused identifiers with `_`** (e.g. required-by-signature
  stub params, ignored destructured fields). `no-unused-vars` ignores `^_`; this
  is the only sanctioned way to keep an unused binding.
- **Never add per-package Prettier overrides.** One config, entire monorepo.
- `pnpm format:check` and `pnpm lint` must pass before every PR. The pre-commit
  hook enforces this locally; CI enforces it on every push.
- **No Biome.** ESLint is required for the custom `no-restricted-imports` SDK
  boundary rule. Running both would be redundant overhead.

### Commands

```bash
pnpm format          # write formatting fixes across the whole repo
pnpm format:check    # check formatting without writing (used in CI)
pnpm lint            # run ESLint
pnpm lint:fix        # run ESLint with auto-fix
```

## Hard architectural rules — critical violations

The most likely rules to be accidentally broken. Full reference with context: `docs/architecture-rules.md`.

- **SDK boundary (ESLint enforced):** plugins must not import from `runtime/src`; use `@sovereignfs/sdk` only.
- **SDK zero-deps:** `packages/sdk` must not import `@sovereignfs/db` or `@sovereignfs/mailer`. Implementations are host-provided via `provideHost()` in `runtime/instrumentation.ts` → `runtime/src/sdk-host.ts`.
- **Extend `packages/tsconfig`:** every new package/app must extend `base`/`nextjs`/`library`.
- **Platform data layer is always async:** always `await getPlatformDb()`, `await getConfig()`, and all `packages/db` helpers — even on SQLite.
- **No secrets with defaults:** `AUTH_SECRET`, `SOVEREIGN_AUTH_SECRET`, etc. must throw on startup if unset.
- **Never `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` for runtime-varying values:** Next.js inlines these at build time; Docker images build without `.env`, so the value is frozen to its fallback regardless of what's in the container's env.
- **Middleware `/login` redirect must be `303` not `307`:** 307 preserves the HTTP method — an unauthenticated POST redirects as `POST /login` → 405. Also target `SOVEREIGN_AUTH_PUBLIC_URL` (browser-reachable), never the internal `SOVEREIGN_AUTH_URL`.
- **Intra-overlay navigation must use `<Link replace>`:** dialog is dismissed with `router.back()` — push-based navigation stacks history and a single back only closes one tab, not the dialog.
- **Never `'unsafe-inline'` in `script-src`:** CSP is nonce-based; the pre-paint theme script uses a hash (`THEME_SCRIPT_CSP_HASH`). Run `applyCsp` on every middleware return path.
- **CSP `form-action` must include the auth origin:** the logout form POST 303-redirects cross-origin to `SOVEREIGN_AUTH_PUBLIC_URL`; `'self'` alone silently blocks it.
- **`'use client'` components: never read browser globals in `useState` initializer or render** — causes hydration mismatches. Initialise to a safe value, read in `useEffect`.
- **Never add `runtime/app/api/*` segment without updating `RESERVED_API_SEGMENTS`** in `runtime/src/api-namespace.ts` — the dir-parity test will fail CI.
- **Profile self-mutations must clear both `session_data` cookie variants** (`better-auth.session_data` and `__Secure-better-auth.session_data`, `maxAge: 0`) — otherwise the cached name/avatar stays stale for up to 300s.
- **Never drop `pnpm-workspace.yaml` COPY from Dockerfiles** — `findWorkspaceRoot()` uses it to resolve `/app`; without it, SQLite files land outside the named volume and data is lost on container recreate.
- **Plugin tables are slug-prefixed** (`tasks_lists`, `splitify_groups`); add `tenant_id` to every user-scoped table.
- **`session.freshAge: 0` in `apps/auth/src/auth.ts`** — don't re-enable without a re-auth flow (regression test asserts this).
- **Server-to-server calls to better-auth must send `Origin` header** equal to `SOVEREIGN_AUTH_URL` — CSRF check rejects originless POSTs with 403.

## Design system (`packages/ui`)

`packages/ui` is the **Sovereign Design System** — a public contract for plugin
developers, versioned with the same discipline as the SDK. Breaking a token name
or component API breaks every third-party plugin that uses it.

### Technology

- **Tokens:** CSS custom properties in plain `.css` files — universally
  consumable from any CSS, framework-agnostic, RSC-safe. No JS import required
  to use tokens.
- **Components:** React + CSS Modules — zero extra dependencies, built into
  Next.js, familiar, RSC-safe by default.
- **No Tailwind.** No runtime CSS-in-JS. No third-party component framework.

### Token architecture — two tiers

```
Primitive tokens     raw scale, no semantic meaning
  --sv-grey-50 … --sv-grey-950
  --sv-space-1 … --sv-space-16
  --sv-font-size-sm … --sv-font-size-2xl
  --sv-radius-sm / -md / -lg
        │
        ▼  mapped by semantic layer
Semantic tokens      contextual meaning, what plugin devs use
  --sv-color-surface
  --sv-color-text-primary
  --sv-shadow-card
  --sv-radius-md
```

Plugin developers reference **semantic colour tokens** — never primitive
colours directly. The semantic colour layer is the theming surface that tenant
theming (CON-08) and dark mode override at `:root` / `[data-theme]`; primitives
stay fixed. The scale tokens (`--sv-space-*`, `--sv-radius-*`,
`--sv-font-size-*`) have no separate semantic tier — they are theme-stable and
used directly. See `docs/design-system.md` for the full model. The v1 identity
is **monochrome** (accent = near-black on light, near-white on dark); a tenant
adds colour by overriding `--sv-color-accent`.

### Token prefix

All tokens use `--sv-*` — short, consistent with the `sv` CLI identity, and
unambiguous. **Never abbreviate after the prefix** — use full descriptive names:
`--sv-color-text-primary` not `--sv-ctp`.

### What plugin developers consume

```ts
// Components — typed React components
import { Button, Card, Input, Badge } from '@sovereignfs/ui';

// Tokens — already injected globally by the runtime shell.
// Reference directly in plugin CSS without any import:
// color: var(--sv-color-text-primary);
// background: var(--sv-color-surface);
```

### Scope rules

- The runtime shell and Console plugin use both tokens and components.
- Plugin developers may use any component or token.
- Components must never hardcode values — always reference `--sv-*` tokens.
- Dark mode and tenant theming work by swapping semantic token values at `:root`;
  no component changes required.

## Native mobile app (post-v1 plan)

Mobile is out of scope for v1 but the approach is decided — do not treat it as
an open question or suggest alternatives.

**Model:** Universal Capacitor shell app — one binary on the App Store / Play
Store. On first launch the user enters their self-hosted instance URL. The app
loads it in a WebView. All Sovereign functionality is served by the user's
instance and runs unchanged. Multiple instances supported. Same pattern as
Nextcloud, Bitwarden, Element (Matrix).

**Shell:** Capacitor (single TypeScript codebase for iOS + Android). Lives in a
separate `sovereign-mobile` repository, not this monorepo.

**Device API tiers — in priority order:**

1. **Web APIs** — `navigator.geolocation`, `getUserMedia` etc. Work natively in
   WebViews, also work in browser/PWA. Use these first.
2. **Capacitor plugins** — for what Web APIs can't cover: native photo picker,
   APNs/FCM push notifications, Face ID / fingerprint, haptics, background
   location.
3. **`sdk.device.*`** — the SDK abstraction plugin developers call. Detects
   environment, routes to the correct tier. Plugins never call Web APIs or
   Capacitor directly.

**Plugin developers use `sdk.device.*` only.** This keeps plugins portable
across browser, PWA, and native shell without changes.

See SRS §3.12 for the full specification.

### Package naming and scope

One owned npm scope for everything: **`@sovereignfs/*`**. The `fs` denotes
_federated systems_ — reflecting the project's long-term federated direction
(federation itself is a post-v1 concern; see SRS §1.4 non-goals).

- `packages/sdk` → `@sovereignfs/sdk` — **published** (plugin contract).
- `packages/ui` → `@sovereignfs/ui` — **published** (design system).
- `packages/db` → `@sovereignfs/db` — internal, `"private": true`.
- `packages/manifest` → `@sovereignfs/manifest` — internal, `"private": true`.
- `packages/mailer` → `@sovereignfs/mailer` — internal, `"private": true`.
- `packages/tsconfig` → `@sovereignfs/tsconfig`. Not published and not imported
  in code; consumed only via TypeScript `extends`
  (`@sovereignfs/tsconfig/base.json` etc.), declared as a `workspace:*`
  devDependency by each consumer.

The "do not publish" signal is `"private": true` in the package's
`package.json` — **not** the scope. A single scope we own avoids the
dependency-confusion risk of aliasing a scope owned by someone else
(`@sovereign` is taken on npm; `@sovereignos`/`-stack`/`-core` collide with
existing products). Only `sdk` and `ui` ever reach npm.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm install            # install workspace deps
pnpm build              # turbo build — packages (tsup) → generate → apps (next build)
pnpm dev                # start dev servers; generate runs automatically on startup
pnpm format             # write Prettier formatting fixes across repo
pnpm format:check       # check formatting without writing (CI)
pnpm lint               # ESLint incl. SDK import-boundary rule
pnpm lint:fix           # ESLint with auto-fix
pnpm typecheck          # tsc --noEmit across packages
pnpm test               # run Vitest across the repo
pnpm test:watch         # Vitest in watch mode
pnpm test:unit          # unit/component tests with verbose output
pnpm test:integration   # cross-service integration tests (root __tests__/integration/)
pnpm test:e2e           # end-to-end tests (root __tests__/e2e/)
pnpm install:plugins    # clone sovereign/community plugins declared in sovereign.plugins.json
pnpm registry:validate  # fetch + validate registry/plugins.json entries, write content-hash provenance
pnpm registry:check     # verify-only (no write) — CI runs this on registry/ changes
```

## Dev DX notes

- **No manual rebuilds in dev.** `pnpm dev` runs `scripts/dev.ts`: composes plugins, starts the generate watcher, and runs `next dev` on `:3000`. HMR handles all subsequent changes.
- **Package changes → instant HMR.** All workspace packages are in `transpilePackages` in both `next.config.ts` files. Next.js compiles source directly — no `tsup --watch`.
- **Plugin changes → HMR via re-copy.** `scripts/dev.ts` runs generate in `--watch` mode; an edit under `plugins/[id]/app/` re-copies into the route group and Next hot-reloads. Plugins are copies, not symlinks — Next's dev watcher does not follow symlinks.
- **tsup is production-only** — not part of the dev pipeline. It runs during `pnpm build` to emit `dist/` for Docker/npm.
- **Profile self-mutations must clear both `session_data` cookie variants** (`better-auth.session_data` + `__Secure-better-auth.session_data`, `maxAge: 0`). The session cache is 300s; without clearing it, the chrome still shows the old name/avatar until it expires. Done in `runtime/app/api/account/avatar/route.ts` and `plugins/account/app/actions.ts`.
- **Middleware verifies sessions offline** via better-auth's signed cookie cache (`session.cookieCache`, 300s, HMAC key = `SOVEREIGN_AUTH_SECRET ?? AUTH_SECRET`), then falls back to `GET /api/verify`. Forward better-auth's `Set-Cookie` on cache miss so the cache self-refreshes. The runtime service needs `AUTH_SECRET` in every compose file.
- **Account profile page reads authoritative session** with `GET /api/auth/get-session?disableCookieCache=true` — plain `get-session` honours the cache and returns a stale value after a self-edit.

## Environment notes

- Node ≥20 (dev on 24.x), pnpm 11.5.2 (pinned via `packageManager`).
- pnpm 11 blocks dependency build scripts by default. `esbuild` (via `tsx`) and
  `better-sqlite3` are allowlisted in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` under `allowBuilds`
  — required for their native bindings. `simple-git-hooks` is set to `false`
  there (the root `prepare` script installs the hooks instead).
- **Shared dev tooling is pinned via the pnpm `catalog:`** in
  `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (`typescript`, `tsup`). Every package references them as
  `"typescript": "catalog:"` / `"tsup": "catalog:"` — never a literal version.
  This stops `pnpm add` from floating one package onto a different major (it
  once pulled TS 6 into a single package). When adding `typescript`/`tsup` to a
  new package, use `catalog:`; to bump the version, edit the catalog once.

## Status

✅ **Phases 0.3–0.9 complete** — monorepo scaffold · shared packages (db, manifest, mailer, ui, sdk) · auth server · runtime · Docker (dev + prod) · console/launcher/account plugins · `sv` CLI · PWA · Postgres validation · SDK stability + distribution · overlay/minimal shell modes · security headers + nonce CSP · CI pipeline · registry + contribution process · versioning · session verification · cross-plugin data sharing · activity log · Drizzle-kit migrations + backup/restore · user data portability · icon system · plugin templates · test seeding · plugin-scoped env vars · mobile responsiveness · MFA (TOTP + passkeys) · accessibility audit · PM2 deployment · platform roles + capabilities · plugin-declared capabilities · notification center · web push · plugin monetization (Ed25519 tokens, entitlements, license generator) · per-plugin database · E2E golden-path suite · Storybook · production dev-mode + diagnostics · white-labeling Phase 1.

✅ **Recent completions:**

- Task 0.8.02 — Per-plugin database (RFC 0004; `@sovereignfs/db` → 1.5.0, `@sovereignfs/sdk` → 1.9.0, `runtime` → 0.26.0). `database: "isolated"` manifest field gives a plugin its own SQLite file or Postgres schema; `sdk.db.getClient()` provisions and returns the dedicated client; migrations run per-plugin at boot; `sv plugin remove` drops the store unless `--keep-data` is passed.
- Task 0.9.01 — E2E golden-path test suite (Playwright; 20 tests in 6 spec files: auth, launcher, account, console, navigation, paywall). `playwright.config.ts` with dual `webServer`, global setup seeds users + keypair, `adminPage`/`userPage` fixtures. `.github/workflows/e2e.yml` CI job.
- Task 1.0.08 — Storybook for the design system (`@sovereignfs/ui`). Storybook 10 (`@storybook/react-vite`); stories for Token Gallery, Button, Input, Icon, Dialog, Drawer. `storybook-build` CI job.
- Task 1.0.02 — Production dev-mode & diagnostics (RFC 0020; `runtime` → 0.27.0). Per-request dev-mode switch via `SOVEREIGN_DEV_MODE_ENABLED` + header secret; context-aware `runtime/src/db.ts` routes to mock DB in dev-mode; structured `LOG_LEVEL` logger; richer `/api/admin/health` response.
- Task 1.0.03 — White-labeling Phase 1 (RFC 0027; `runtime` → 0.28.0). `instance_config` table (was `tenant_branding`) + `InstanceProvider` server component; `--sv-instance-logo/dark/favicon` tokens + `--sv-color-accent` override from hex; instance API routes (`/api/instance/*`); Console Instance identity section; `sdk.platform.getConfig()` returns `instanceName`/`instancePrimaryColor`.
- Console plugin install/remove UX — real two-step server-side flow (fetch manifest preview → confirm install via `sv plugin add`; confirm remove via `sv plugin remove`). Platform-plugin guard uses `plugin.type === 'platform'`.
- Task 0.9.0 — Instance identity rename (RFC 0032; `@sovereignfs/ui` → 0.11.0, `@sovereignfs/sdk` → 1.11.0, `@sovereignfs/db` → 1.7.0, `runtime` → 0.29.0). Pure rename: `BRAND_*` env vars → `INSTANCE_*`, `--sv-brand-*` tokens → `--sv-instance-*`, `brandName`/`brandPrimaryColor` → `instanceName`/`instancePrimaryColor`, `tenant_branding` table → `instance_config`, `BrandProvider` → `InstanceProvider`, `/api/brand/` routes → `/api/instance/`.
